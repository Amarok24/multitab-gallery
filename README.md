# MultiTab-Gallery (v1.0)
- A simple library written in TypeScript and CSS (uses CSS 3 features for animation).
- Easy to integrate (but you will have to use your coding skills to adjust it if needed).
- Minimalistic, tiny filesize.
- Zero dependencies.
- Fully responsive.
- Free and open source.

## Note
index.html needs to run in a live-server environment (because JS modules are used).
