# MultiTab-Gallery (v1.0.2)
- A simple library written in TypeScript and CSS (uses CSS 3 features for animation).
- Minimalistic, tiny filesize (only 3kb bundled & minified).
- Zero dependencies.
- Easy to integrate (but you will have to use your coding skills to make adjustments).
- Fully responsive.
- Free and open source.

## Note
'index.html' needs to run in a live-server environment if JS modules are used. An alternative way is to load the bundled JS code which runs offline. Both examples are included in the index file.
